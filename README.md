# Food Delivery React Native

This is a repository containing the source code for a food delivery app developed using React Native. The app allows users to explore different restaurants, view their menus, and place orders for delivery.

## Features

The food delivery app has the following main features:

- *Explore Restaurants:* Users can browse through a list of available restaurants on the platform. Each restaurant is presented with an appealing image, a brief description, and an average rating.

- *View Menus:* Upon selecting a specific restaurant, users can view the complete menu offered by that restaurant. Each menu item displays its name, description, price, and an illustrative image.

- *Place Orders:* Users have the ability to select desired items from the menu and add them to the shopping cart. They can adjust the quantity of each item and view the corresponding subtotal.
